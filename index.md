# The Locally Trivial Seminar #

## General Information ##

The Locally Trivial Seminar is a student seminar at the University of Toronto. The goal of the seminar is to provide a forum for informal collaborative talks given by seminar attendees on all things loosely related to algebraic topology. By loosely related we mean to include algebraic topology itself (of course), K-theory, derived algebraic geometry (or other related areas of algebraic geometry), differential topology, and the relevant ideas in geometric topology. The exact direction of the seminar is to be determined by the attendees.

We hope that by attending the seminar you gain a deeper understanding of the fields relating to algebraic topology and how they all fit together.

## Attending & Speaking ##

Time & Location: Tuesdays @ 11:00am in TBD.

To sign up to speak please rank your 3 favourite open slots in our schedule in an email to one of the organizers. In this email please include your proposed topic.

The expectation is that if you are regularly attending the seminar, you will at some point speak. Your talk doesn't need to be polished or fully complete, just pick a topic that you find interesting. We especially encourage you to work through examples that you find have helped elucidate a complicated topic! Some examples of things one could talk about:
- Why does K-theory appear in differential topology
- What is the $S_\bullet$ consturction and why is it useful
- Who cares about higher concordances in $\infty$-cateogry theory
- My first non-trivial spectral sequence computation
- Quotients in higher algebra versus ordinary algebra
- What are the terms in the surgery exact sequence
- What is the Spivak normal fibration and why is it reducible for manifolds
- Why you should derive your algebraic geometry
- What is a factorization algebra
- Classifying spaces in topology and algebraic geometry
- Modern simple homotopy theory
