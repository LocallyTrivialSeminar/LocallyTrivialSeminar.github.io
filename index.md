## General Information ##

The Locally Trivial Seminar is a student seminar at the University of Toronto. The goal of the seminar is provide a forum for informal collaborative talks given by seminar attendees on all things loosly related to algebraic topology. By loosly related we mean to include algebraic topology itself (of course), K-theory, derived algebraic geometry (or other related areas of algebraic geometry), differentail topology and geometry. The exact direction of the seminar is to be given by the atendees.

We hope that as you attend the seminar more you gain a deeper understanding of the fields relating to algebraic topology and how they all fit togehter.

## Attending & Speaking ##

Time & Location: TBD with talks lasting anywhere between 1 and 2 hours.

The expectation is that if you are regularly attending the seminar, you will at some point be asked to speak.
